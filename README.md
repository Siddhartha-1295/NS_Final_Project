#We use Python programming to run our program. The libraries we use are Deep Graph Library (DGL), PyTorch, and NetworkX. Before running the program we need to install these packages using pip install.
#To run our program, you can use the attached project_networkx_Final.ipynb file with Colab. To upload the datasets and label lists the user needs to replace the necessary paths in the  ‘Experiment’ section with the path from their own drive.
#Necessary Inputs: 
#Select Dataset: (input 1,2, or 3) 1 - cora; 2 -citeseer; 3 - pubmed 
#Select the decomposition between Truss and core: ‘core’ or ‘truss’
#Percentage of chains Truss/Core (must be >= 0 and < 1) : 
#Percentage of chains Louvain (must be >= 0 and < 1):
